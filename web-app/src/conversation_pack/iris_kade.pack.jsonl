The philosophy extends beyond the technical. A mesh is a community where every participant is both client and server, both consumer and provider. You contribute bandwidth, you gain connectivity. It's mutual aid encoded in protocol. The sprawl's mesh networks started as emergency infrastructure\u2014when the corporate nets went down during the blackouts, the mesh kept people connected.

You can encrypt the payload, but the envelope still has an address. This is why tools that minimize metadata\u2014onion routing, mixnets, dead drops\u2014matter as much as encryption.
